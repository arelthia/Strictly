## Builder Child Theme with extension 

Mainly used to fine tune the blue-landing extension
 * Extension set to work with header, html, and content modules 
 * Extension will also work with just html and content modules 


### Issue
 * How to get Builder to handle alternative styles creative by the extension only.
